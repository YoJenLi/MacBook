In a data-rich profile of LinkedIn editorial head Dan Roth, Digiday's John
McDermott reveals how much.

The social network has a "disproportionately wealthy user base," McDermott
writes, citing the analytics company comScore.

"More than 40% of LinkedIn visitors earn more than $100,000 per year," he
continues, "higher than 31% average for the entire web."

看來比1111/104強大太多,板上用Linkedin年薪破300萬的應該有40%無誤,Obov 22萬鎂?

LOL
