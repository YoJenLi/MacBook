本人上個禮拜有收到一封奇怪的信, 直覺是詐騙, 各位有遇過嗎?


寄件者: Jamal Goni

As I intend to communicate with you, my late client made a Deposit amounting a sum of $13,500,000.00 million U.S. dollars with a bank overseas in 2010. I was contacted on the 5th day of Febrauary, 2015 by the holding bank after the death of late Mr. Luth to locate members of his extended family who could be beneficiaries to his abandoned personal assets. More so, I have received official letters in the past weeks suggesting proceedings for confiscation of his deposited funds in accordance with
the existing laws. This is because it is assumed that no member of his extended family is alive.



After exhaustive search through the embassy and on professional consideration, I engaged a wide search to locate a credible person with this last name, I had to look for someone with the same last name so as to avoid confiscation. I have contacted you on professional consideration as I know that you will be able to receive this fund successfully and legitimately without any form of complications. I am here saying that the procedure to be adopted in receiving the funds will be legitimate and we will
ensure not to break the law. All I ask is for you to receive this funds as I will advice. I propose that 80% of the total sum will be set aside for you and 20% will be set aside for me after the funds are transferred to you.



I will appreciate verbal communication with you so we can discuss in details. Kindly provide me your private telephone number and advice on the best time to call you.
