我3/5面試中科台積秘書，今天收到感謝函，如下：

The response to our company’s recent recruitment drive was overwhelming.
All of the applicants were of very high caliber. As such, it was extremely
difficult to choose only one from amongst such outstanding candidates.

However, after long and deliberate consideration, we regret to inform you
that your application for the job at TSMC has been unsuccessful. This is no
way a reflection on your skills and experience, as most of these applicants
had skills and knowledge that were very similar to yours, which is to say,
extremely exceptional and outstanding. As long as a suitable timing and
vacancy opens up next time, your continuous interest will be highly
appreciated.

We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. Thank you for
applying to join TSMC.

Best Wishes
Recruiting Team, TSMC
