A maintenance contractor called out to fix a hydrofluoric acid leak at a
Samsung plant has died in hospital, according to Korean media.

Four others were injured by the lethal gas but have reportedly been discharged.

The factory in question is located within South Korea, which isn't known for
the sort of lax safety standards that plague workers in China, but AsiaE
reports that the accident will nevertheless be investigated to find out if any
laws were breached in the way the leak was handled, and if the killed
contractor was wearing the right protective gear.

For the sake of context, it's worth remembering that even state-of-the-art
installations can be prone to accidents
