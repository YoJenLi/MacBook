Windows RT is Microsoft's biggest mess

不錯的科技文.有一段寫的很生動

Customer: Can I run my Windows apps on this tablet? Like Photoshop?

Salesperson: No, because it's running Windows RT, which is different to
Windows 8 and can't run standard apps

Customer: But it looks exactly like Windows 8! Why won't the apps run?

Salesperson: It isn't Windows 8 though, and it can't run the apps because it
runs on different hardware

Customer: Well that's confusing...
