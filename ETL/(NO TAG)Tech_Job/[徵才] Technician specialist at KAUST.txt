King Abdullah University of Science and Technology(KAUST)

Job Purpose:
A joint engineer position is available for working on a collaborative project
under the supervision of Dr. Zhong Lin Wang at Georgia Institute of
Technology (Georgia Tech) and Dr. Jr-Hau He at King Abdullah University of
Science and Technology (KAUST). The candidate will work and be based at KAUST
but will spend some times in Dr. Zhong Lin Wang's lab at Georgia Tech to
learn the device fabrication.
The candidate will develop a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENT) system. This
research is expected to harvest water energy from ocean using an integrated
assembly of small unit triboelectric generator in a 3D network. A competitive
salary is offered to prospective candidates (offer ~50K USD/year for the
engineer with MS degree, tax free at KAUST).

Duties and Responsibilities:
A R&D engineer will develop TENT system and self-powered sensor based on TENT
in ocean and be responsible for inventing, reapplying, and preparing for,
process, packaging technologies, and market breakthrough product.
The R&D engineer need to work in a variety of roles including designing and
testing machinery, developing ways of improving existing processes for
meeting the needs for commercialization.
  For more details about TENT for harvesting ocean energy, please refer
