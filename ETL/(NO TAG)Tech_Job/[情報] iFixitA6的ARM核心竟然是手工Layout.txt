According to iFixIt:

When compared to the rigid, efficient layout of the GPU cores directly below
it, the layout of the ARM cores looks a little homespun—at first.

- Generally, logic blocks are automagically laid out with the use of advanced
computer software. However, it looks like the ARM core blocks were laid out
manually—as in, by hand.

- A manual layout will usually result in faster processing speeds, but it is
much more expensive and time consuming.

- The manual layout of the ARM processors lends much credence to the rumor
that Apple designed a custom processor of the same caliber as the all-new
Cortex-A15, and it just might be the only manual layout in a chip to hit the
market in several years.

雖然我對Intrinsity真的採取Full Costum保持懷疑，Manual Layout這個說法也太籠統。

不過感覺得出來阿婆已經開始朝用 ARM 架構授權而自行開發處理器的路發展。現在在A6

這個看到高度客製化的成果，又看到IP5一無可取得超爛發表會，難道阿婆開始要走硬體

路線嗎?
