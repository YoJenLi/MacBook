PHP programmer needed
I am a young entrepreneur and PHP developer working on my own webprojects.

I am looking for a co-worker PHP developer that will be responsible for
certain parts of the code, developing new features, fixing bugs, etc.
Students are preferred.

Required: good experience with PHP; enough English to communicative, read,
and write.
Location: Office room in my apartment in Tianmu close to Takashimaya
Shopping Centre.

You need to be able to work at least 20 hours a week and
the more you can work, the better.

You will be able to come to the office almost any day of the week from
early morning until midnight to join me in the work. Your schedule is totally
 flexible since this is not a full-time job, it's just a short-term ad-hoc
type of work.

I am working almost non-stop, the projects are a lot of challenge, fun,
and potential.

The salary is 300$ per hour.

If interested, please write a PHP script with the functionality of
http://ryanwebinno.net84.net/ with fictional database login data and
send it to me in email to ryanwebinno@yahoo.com with a short description
of yourself, information about how many hours a week you want to work,
 and what days and times you want to work.

Thank you for your time!
Ryan
